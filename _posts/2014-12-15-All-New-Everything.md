After a couple of months of searching, travelling and interviewing I finally found my new spot to squeeze my mind grapes and crank out code. About four months ago I started working as a UI Engineer at [Optimizely] [optly]. I had a few reasons behind this decision. I had other options, but [Optimizely] [optly] had a few things going for it.


First, the position was under the Design team. This is a first for me as I have always been under the umbrella of Engineering. I thought that this might give me the opportunity to learn a bit more about product design and be a bit more visually creative. This also allows me to focus largely on the front end; which I'd been doing for a few years now, but it was always more full stack.


Second, I was taken by [Optimizely's] [optly] Design Director Tommy Giglio. He gave me one hell of a pitch that made me see beyond A/B testing. Marketing & Sales technologies have come a long way in the past few years and it is a crowded space with many specializations. [Optimizely's] [optly] opportunity here is quite large. They have a great brand for testing, but they are positioned to be able to do much more and I see a lot of value in the possibilities there.


After four months I have seen more change and more hard work than anywhere else in my career. I feel more energized being around smart people who are willing to take chances and make big bets. I look forward to what else is to come.
