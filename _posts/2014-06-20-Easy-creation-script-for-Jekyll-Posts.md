Since I have started using Jekyll for blog like sites I was initially frustrated in all of the boilerplate that had to be written in simple post creation. So I wrote a little script to help generate the basic Jekyll boilerplate front-matter.

I feel like this sort of thing really belongs in Jekyll itself since it is all boilerplate for posts, but until then this works. Enjoy.
