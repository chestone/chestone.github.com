Hello there Internet!

I am finally re-organizing my life online and this blog is a part of that. I've taken some time off and am getting back to work. I am hoping that I will use that time to chronicle my experiences looking for a job in San Francisco and hopefully finding something that I can dedicate my time and energy to that makes me happy. I will probably make a few technical posts as well since I have a few side projects I'll be working on during the mean time. See all of you around!
